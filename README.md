# Object Orientated Blackjack (Python)
Welcome to my Blackjack project.I built this while studying my BSc in Software Engineering to get a head start on Python and learn more about coding.

# Features of this project
*Classes for everything: Instead of just variables, I used classes for Card, Deck, Hand, and Chips. It makes the code way easier to manage and navigate.

*The "Ace" Problem: I spent some time figuring out the logic to make Aces count as 1 or 11 automatically so the player doesn't bust unfairly.

*Dealer AI: The dealer isn't random , it follows the standard rule of hitting until it hits 17 (casino rules)

*Crash-proof: I added some try and except blocks so if a user types something unusual instead of a number for their bet, the game doesn't just end.

# How I built it
I used Python 3 and focused heavily on logic flow. This project helped me really wrap my head around how classes interact with each other and how to keep track of a "game state" across multiple rounds.

# How to play
1.Make sure you have Python installed.
2.Grab the blackjack.py file.
3.Run it in your terminal: python blackjack.py
4.Try not to go broke!
